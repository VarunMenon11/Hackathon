# Hackathon

During our first Year in College,
My team was Nominated for the final in Smart India Hackthon. Our topic was Virtual Experimental Lab.

Our goal is to create a virtual lab for those College that doesnt have enough/no Equipments for practical learning. We created the games and App for free to download to help students. This Games can be 
Played whether in college, home, etc. The only requiremnt is a Laptop/Computer.
